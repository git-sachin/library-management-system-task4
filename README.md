# 📊 Task 4 – Aggregate Functions and Grouping (Library Management System)

## 📌 Overview
This task demonstrates how to use **aggregate functions** and **grouping** in SQL on the **Library Management System** database created in Task 1 & 2.  
We apply functions like `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `COUNT` along with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`.

## 🗂️ Queries Demonstrated

### 1. Aggregate Functions
- Total number of books (`COUNT(*)`)  
- Total available copies of books (`SUM`)  
- Average available copies (`AVG`)  
- Oldest and newest published books (`MIN`, `MAX`)  

### 2. GROUP BY
- Count books by each author.  
- Average available copies grouped by published year.  

### 3. HAVING
- Authors who have written more than one book.  
- Years where total available copies exceed 10.

## 📂 Files Included
- **`task4_aggregate_queries.sql`** → SQL script with all aggregate and grouping queries.  
- **`README_Task4.md`** → Documentation explaining queries and outcomes.

## ✅ Outcome
By completing this task, you will learn how to:  
- Summarize numeric data using aggregate functions.  
- Categorize results using `GROUP BY`.  
- Filter grouped results using `HAVING`.  

This builds the foundation for **data summarization and analysis** in SQL.
